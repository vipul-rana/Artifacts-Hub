<h3>Our Journey</h3>
<h4>
   When we got into this wonderful business of selling these magnificient pieces of art. Though they say it appears to be just yesterday when 
they started out on this path, why, because its been such a fulfilling ride all throughout,being surrounded by the absolutely beautiful sculptures and statues, 
getting to know and learn about different cultures and religions through them,meeting and interacting such extraordinary talented artists who make them, 
and there is nothing more satisfactory than seeing someone choosing statue of his/her choice or rather should we say statue choosing him/her.
To continue doing it with the same passion and zeal we have been thinking how can we expand the reach of this lovely art to everyone worldwide. 
And we then came across this idea of selling it online through e-commerce, thereby taking this art and knowledge around them to every nook and corner of the world. 
Thats how and why, our website was born.
